                    I was born in Benoni, South Africa in 1994.
                    I studied Fine Arts at the university of Pretoria and graduated in 2018.
                    I have been living and teaching in Vietnam since 2019, while trying to focus on 
                    travelling and expanding my portfolio. I look forward to having you on this journey
                    with me.
